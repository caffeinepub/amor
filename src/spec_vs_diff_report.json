  "summary": "REQ-17 appears implemented by removing the Caffeine attribution from the footer. REQ-16 is only partially evidenced: SelectItem sentinel values like \"all\" are present, but the ShopPage Select components still use an empty-string Select `value` when state is null, which may not satisfy the requirement to show placeholder/cleared state without empty values.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-16",
      "requirement": "Each Shop filter must support an 'all/default' selection that clears the corresponding filter state to null and shows the placeholder text (cleared state).",
      "reason": "In the diff, the Select components are controlled with `value={... || ''}`. Using an empty string as the Select value when the state is null can prevent the placeholder state from showing correctly (many Select implementations require `undefined` to show placeholder), and it reintroduces an empty-string value path even though SelectItem values are non-empty.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/ShopPage.tsx (Select value={category || ''}, goldType || '', etc. shown)"

      "id": "REQ-16",
      "requirement": "All filter dropdowns on ShopPage (Category, Gold Type, Stone Type, Sort By) have no SelectItem with value=\"\".",
      "reason": "Only the Category dropdown is visible in the truncated diff; the Gold Type / Stone Type / Sort By SelectItem lists are not fully shown, so it cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary that none of them include `value=\"\"`.",
